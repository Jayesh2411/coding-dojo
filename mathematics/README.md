1. Arithmatic Progression:


Series : 2,4,6, .... 10 
a = 2
l = 16


Sum = n* avgnum
or 
Sum  = n*((a+l)/2)


Avg = 1,2,3,4,5 -- 3

Avg = 1+5/2 = 6/2 -- 3


2. Geometric Progression:

2,4,8,16,32

Sum = a*(1-r^n)/(1-r)
or
Sum = a+ar+ar^2  ... + ar^n-1

3. Quadratic Equation:

aX^2+bX+c = 0 

X = -b{+/-} SquareRoot(b^2 - 4*a*c) / (2*a)

D<0 Imaginary Roots
D=0 Two equal roots
D>0 Two distinct roots

4. Mean:

Add all N digits and divide by N

4,1,7 ==> (4+1+7)/3 = 4

4. Median:
Sort the N digits, and take the mid from it if N is Odd
else do data[mid]+data[(mid+1)]/2

4,1,7 = 1,4,7 = 4


5. Prime Numbers:
2,3 or (6n-1) , (6n+1) n is a natural num

6. Factors:
if n is divisible completely by a,b or c they are factors

7. HCF
Two nums have set of factors, among both set create an intersection set. They maax among the set is HCF 


8. LCM 
Two num have many multiples ex- 4 , 8, 12 
The lopwest multiple common in both set is LCM


9. Permutation:
Arrangement of r things in n things

nPr = n!/(n-r)!

Ex : From 10 winners, 3 ppl can be arranged in gold, silver and bronze as 10P3

10. Combination:
Selection of r things out of n things

nCr  =  n!/r!*(n-r)!

10C3
Ex : Picking 3 dresses from the wardrobe of 10 dress

11. Modular Arithmetic:

Remainder of division of two operands: a%b = Rem of a/b
